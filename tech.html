But did you know the term "robot" comes from a Czech word, robota, meaning "forced labour"? We just hope they never discover that to be the case as we're fairly sure that's when the robot uprising will begin.</p>

               Vladimir Lukyanov built something like this in 1936 but he used water to create a computer that solved partial differential equations. In images of the Lukyanov computer, you'll see a complex system of interconnected tubes filled with water.</p>

            <p class="mb-auto"><strong>It would take 76 work days (8 hours a day) for the average person to read the Terms and Conditions they agree to in a year.</strong>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, crunched the numbers to find out how long it'd take the average person to read the privacy policies they agree to in a year.
          Their calculations were somewhat shocking; concluding that the average internet user would have to spend 76 work days to read the things they'd agreed to online.
          They made their calculations based on the median length of the top 75 websites' privacy policies, which came in at 2,514 words. Another variable was how long it took the average person to understand the policy, which they based on a comprehensive questionnaire given to 212 participants of the study.</p>
