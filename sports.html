            <p class="card-text mb-auto"><strong>A baseball fan was hit twice by consecutive foul balls.</strong> There's more protection for spectators these days, but every baseball fan knows there's still a small chance of a foul ball flying your
              way. During one Phillies-Giants game in 1957, Richie Ashburn fouled off a ball into the stands that smacked Alice Roth right in the face, breaking her nose. As the medics led her out in the stands, Ashburn hit another foul ball off the
              very next pitch—hitting Roth once again, in the leg this time. Fortunately, she recovered, and the Phillies treated her and her family, per reports, "like royalty.".</p>
