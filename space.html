          <p class="mb-auto"><strong>All of space is almost completely silent.</strong> This is because there is no air in space, and air is needed to carry the sound vibrations.
          So if you shouted to someone next to you in space they wouldn’t be able to hear you. There are some vibrations and sound waves that are imperceptible to humans, but overall, space is a vacuum, and it's pretty darn quiet.</p>

             The IRAM detected a chemical called ethyl formate which gives rum its distinct smell and raspberries their distinct flavor.</p>

                    Ancient astronomers once believed the Earth was at the centre of the Universe but now we know that the Sun is at the centre of our Solar System and our planets orbit the Sun. The Sun makes up 99.8% of the entire mass of the whole Solar System. One million Earths would be needed to be the same size as the Sun.</p>

        <p class="mb-auto"><strong>NASA uses countdowns because of a sci-fi film</strong>
          The countdown Fritz Lang used to create suspense in the rocket launch scene of his 1929 silent film Frau im Mond didn’t just change film history—it also inspired NASA to use countdowns before its own blastoffs. It’s not exactly a race against the clock though. NASA can feel free to pause the clock to check mechanical difficulties.</p>

        <p class="mb-auto"><strong>Gene Cernan wrote his daughter's initials on the moon; they'll last at least 50,000 years.</strong>Humanity hasn't been to the moon for a long while now, but relics from our time there can still be found. Arguably the most famous are the two golf balls that were shot over the lunar surface by the astronaut Alan Shepard on February 6, 2017, at the end of the Apollo 14 mission.
          And one of the most sentimental and personal relics, however, must be the one left by Gene Cernan - the last astronaut on the moon.
          Due to the lack of atmosphere and erosion by wind or water on the lunar surface, the initials - as well as the astronaut's footprints - will last a very, very long time.</p>
